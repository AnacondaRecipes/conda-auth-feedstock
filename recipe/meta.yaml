  summary: Conda plugin for improved access to private channels
  description: |
    Conda auth is a conda plugin which adds more secure authentication support to conda.
    Once installed, it provides two new commands you can use to manage credentials and 
    access private conda channels:
      - conda auth login for logging into a private channel and storing your credentials
      - conda auth logout for logging out of a private channel and removing your credentials
